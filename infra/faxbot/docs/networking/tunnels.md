# Tunnels for iOS & Remote Access

The iOS app requires a reachable URL for your Faxbot server. A tunnel provides secure connectivity from the app to your server even when it’s behind NAT.

## Options

- WireGuard (HIPAA‑capable)
  - Use your own WG server/router (e.g., Firewalla). Restrict access with firewall rules.
  - Keep AMI/SIP/UDPTL private; the tunnel is for API/Admin UI/iOS connectivity.
- Tailscale (HIPAA‑capable)
  - Add your server to a Tailnet with ACLs. Treat Tailnet as a private network.
- Cloudflare Quick Tunnel (dev only)
  - Not HIPAA‑compliant (no BAA; ephemeral). Use only for non‑PHI testing.
  - For HIPAA, consider a Named Tunnel with Access policies and a BAA.

!!! warning "HIPAA"
    HIPAA users should avoid dev‑only tunnels for PHI. Prefer WireGuard or Tailscale with strict ACLs, and keep SIP/AMI private.

## Admin Console

- Configure the tunnel provider and test connectivity from the Console settings.
- Generate a short‑lived iOS pairing code (no secrets in QR or UI).
- Terminal and admin actions remain local‑only; do not expose via tunnels.

## Environment reference (examples)

```env
TUNNEL_ENABLED=false
TUNNEL_PROVIDER=none   # none|cloudflare|wireguard|tailscale

# WireGuard
WIREGUARD_ENDPOINT=router.example.com:51820
WIREGUARD_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY=...
WIREGUARD_CLIENT_IP=10.0.0.100/24
WIREGUARD_DNS=1.1.1.1

# Tailscale
TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY=tskey-...
TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME=faxbot-server
```

## Security notes

- HIPAA posture disables Cloudflare Quick Tunnel in the UI.
- No PHI or secrets appear in logs/UI. Secrets are masked; pairing codes expire quickly.
- `PUBLIC_API_URL` should be HTTPS in production; do not rely on dev tunnels for PHI.

## Troubleshooting

- Use Scripts & Tests to tail tunnel logs (dev only) and run reachability checks.
- Ensure Ghostscript is installed; check readiness/diagnostics if tests fail.
