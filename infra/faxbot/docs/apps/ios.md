# iOS App

The iOS app lets you send faxes and check statuses from your phone. It connects to your own Faxbot server.

## Key points

- A tunnel is required for the iOS app to reach your server (LAN‑only setups won’t work off‑network).
- HIPAA users should use a HIPAA‑capable tunnel (WireGuard or Tailscale). Avoid Cloudflare Quick Tunnels for PHI.
- Pairing uses a short‑lived code generated from the Admin Console. No secrets are embedded in QR codes.

## Setup overview

1. Open the Admin Console and locate the VPN/Tunnel settings.
2. Choose a provider:
   - WireGuard (HIPAA‑capable): connect to your existing WG server (e.g., Firewalla).
   - Tailscale (HIPAA‑capable): join your Tailnet with an appropriately scoped key.
   - Cloudflare Quick Tunnel (dev only): non‑PHI trials; not HIPAA‑compliant.
3. Generate an iOS pairing code and enter it in the iOS app.
