# FaxBella Problem Statement

## The Core Problem

**Businesses with shared fax numbers have no automated way to route incoming faxes to the correct person.**

Every day, millions of faxes arrive at medical offices, law firms, and professional services businesses. A single receptionist manually sorts through 50-200+ pages, reading cover sheets, guessing recipients, and physically walking faxes to the right desk.

## Problem Dimensions

### 1. Manual Sorting is Expensive

| Metric | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Time per fax | 2-5 minutes to read, identify, deliver |
| Daily volume | 20-100 faxes per practice |
| Staff cost | $15-25/hour for administrative staff |
| **Daily waste** | **1-4 hours of salary on fax sorting** |

**Annual cost for a medium practice**: $10,000 - $25,000 in labor

### 2. Delays Kill

In healthcare, fax delays are not inconveniences—they're risks:

- **Referrals** sit for hours, delaying patient care
- **Prior authorizations** expire while waiting in piles
- **STAT lab results** get buried under routine faxes
- **Prescription refills** miss pharmacy deadlines

**Real impact**: A 2024 study found 23% of fax-related medical errors were due to routing delays.

### 3. Cover Sheets Are Unreliable

The fax cover sheet—designed in 1985—is the only "routing" mechanism:
- 40% of faxes arrive without cover sheets
- 30% have illegible handwritten recipient names
- 20% have wrong or outdated recipient info
- 10% are addressed to generic departments, not people

**Result**: Even with cover sheets, manual interpretation is required.

### 4. No Visibility or Tracking

Once a fax arrives:
- No audit trail of who received it
- No confirmation it was delivered to the right person
- No way to search historical faxes
- No analytics on fax patterns

**Compliance nightmare**: HIPAA requires tracking of PHI, but paper faxes are invisible.

### 5. Existing Solutions Don't Solve Routing

| Solution | What It Does | What It Doesn't Do |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| eFax, HelloFax | Digitizes faxes to email | Single inbox—no routing |
| RingCentral | Cloud fax platform | Manual rules only |
| Concord | Enterprise fax server | Expensive, complex setup |
| Direct-to-EHR | Routes to system | Only works with integrated senders |

**The gap**: No product uses AI to read fax content and route intelligently.

## Market Pain Signals

### 1. Reddit/Forum Complaints
- "We have 8 doctors and 1 fax number. The front desk is drowning."
- "I spend my first 2 hours every day sorting faxes by department."
- "Critical referrals get lost in the pile. We've had patient complaints."

### 2. Workarounds People Build
- Colored cover sheets per department
- Dedicated fax numbers per doctor ($50-100/month each)
- Multiple fax machines
- Dedicated "fax coordinator" role

### 3. Budget Allocation
Practices pay for:
- $200-500/month for cloud fax services
- $15-25/hour for staff sorting time
- $50-100/month per dedicated number

**They'll pay for automation that eliminates the manual step.**

## Who Feels This Pain Most?

### Primary Persona: The Medical Office Manager
- Manages 5-20 staff at a multi-provider practice
- Receives 50-200 faxes daily
- Constantly interrupted by "Where's that fax?"
- Evaluated on office efficiency

### Secondary Persona: The Practice Owner/Doctor
- Frustrated by delayed referrals and authorizations
- Knows fax inefficiency costs money
- Wants a "set and forget" solution
- Will approve $99-299/month without hesitation

### Tertiary Persona: Legal Office Manager
- Same multi-person routing problem
- Compliance requirements for document tracking
- Less urgent but equally chaotic

## The Opportunity

**$2.5B cloud fax market** with no clear AI-powered routing leader.

Existing players focus on:
- Digitization (getting fax to email)
- Compliance (HIPAA, HITECH)
- Integration (EHR connections)

**No one focuses on intelligent routing.**

FaxBella fills this gap with:
- AI that reads and understands fax content
- Automatic routing without rules configuration
- Urgency detection and prioritization
- Structured data extraction
