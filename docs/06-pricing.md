| Faxes Used | Monthly Cost | Formula |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 - 1,000 | $55 | 1 block |
| 1,001 - 2,000 | $110 | 2 blocks |
| 2,001 - 3,000 | $165 | 3 blocks |
| 3,001 - 4,000 | $220 | 4 blocks |

Formula: `ceil(usage / 1000) * $55`

## ROI Analysis

### For a Typical Practice

**Assumptions:**
- 50 faxes/day
- $20/hour admin labor
- 3 minutes per fax to sort manually

**Monthly Cost Without FaxBella:**
- 50 faxes x 3 min x 22 days = 3,300 min/month
- 3,300 min / 60 = 55 hours/month
- 55 hours x $20/hour = **$1,100/month in labor**

**Monthly Cost With FaxBella ($55 Membership):**
- Automated routing: $55/month
- Exception handling: 5% x 50 x 3 min x 22 days = 165 min/month
- 165 min / 60 = 2.75 hours x $20 = $55/month
- **Total: $110/month**

**Monthly Savings: $990**
**Annual Savings: $11,880**
**ROI: 1,800%**

## Pricing Objections & Responses

### "eFax is cheaper at $15/month"
> "eFax digitizes faxes but doesn't route them. You still sort manually. FaxBella eliminates that work entirely. The $40 difference saves you 40+ hours/month."

### "We already have a fax solution"
> "Great! FaxBella works alongside your existing fax number. We receive a webhook copy and handle routing. No migration needed."

### "How do I know it'll work for us?"
> "Try it free for 14 days. Route your next 50 faxes and measure the time savings yourself."

### "What if we need more than 1,000 faxes?"
> "No problem. Usage auto-scales in 1,000-fax blocks at $55 each. No per-fax nickel-and-diming. A practice doing 2,000 faxes pays $110/month -- still cheaper than manual sorting."
