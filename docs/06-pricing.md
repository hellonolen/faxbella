## ROI Analysis

### For a Typical Practice

**Assumptions:**
- 50 faxes/day
- $20/hour admin labor
- 3 minutes per fax to sort manually

**Monthly Cost Without FaxBella:**
- 50 faxes × 3 min × 22 days = 3,300 min/month
- 3,300 min ÷ 60 = 55 hours/month
- 55 hours × $20/hour = **$1,100/month in labor**

**Monthly Cost With FaxBella ($99 Business):**
- Automated routing: $99/month
- Exception handling: 5% × 50 × 3 min × 22 days = 165 min/month
- 165 min ÷ 60 = 2.75 hours × $20 = $55/month
- **Total: $154/month**

**Monthly Savings: $946**
**Annual Savings: $11,352**
**ROI: 956%**

## Overage Pricing

For customers who exceed plan limits:

| Plan | Overage Rate |
|------|-------------|
| Starter | $0.20/fax after 100 |

**Positioning:** We sit between commodity cloud fax and enterprise fax servers, offering the AI routing neither provides.

## Pricing Objections & Responses

### "eFax is cheaper at $15/month"
> "eFax digitizes faxes but doesn't route them. You still sort manually. FaxBella eliminates that work entirely. The $84 difference saves you 40+ hours/month."

### "We already have a fax solution"
> "Great! FaxBella works alongside your existing fax number. We receive a webhook copy and handle routing. No migration needed."

### "How do I know it'll work for us?"
> "Try it free for 14 days. Route your next 50 faxes and measure the time savings yourself."

### "What if we need more than 500 faxes?"
> "Enterprise plan covers unlimited faxes. If you're processing 500+/month, you'll definitely benefit from unlimited plus dedicated support."
