# FaxBella Vision

## Mission Statement

**FaxBella transforms the chaos of shared fax lines into intelligent, automated document routing that saves healthcare practices hours of manual sorting every day.**

## The North Star

> "Every fax finds its person, instantly."

## Vision Statement

FaxBella will be the **#1 AI-powered fax routing solution** for healthcare practices, veterinary clinics, law firms, and professional services businesses by 2027.

We envision a world where:
- **No fax sits in a pile waiting to be sorted**
- **AI understands context, urgency, and intent**
- **Healthcare staff focus on patients, not paper**
- **Small practices access enterprise-grade automation**

## Core Values

### 1. Intelligence First
Every feature we build leverages AI to reduce human effort. We don't build dumb automation—we build smart systems that continuously improve.

### 2. Healthcare-Grade Reliability
Faxes carry life-critical information. We treat every fax as if it contains a patient's life-or-death prescription. 99.99% uptime. Zero lost faxes.

### 3. Radical Simplicity
A receptionist with no IT training should set up FaxBella in 10 minutes. If it needs a manual, it's too complicated.

### 4. Transparent Pricing
No hidden fees. No per-fax charges that surprise you. Simple, predictable monthly pricing.

### 5. Privacy by Design
HIPAA isn't a checkbox—it's our architecture. We process, route, and forget. AI learns patterns, not PHI.

## Strategic Pillars

### Pillar 1: AI Routing Engine
The core intelligence that reads, understands, and routes faxes with 95%+ accuracy within 30 seconds of receipt.

### Pillar 2: Multi-Channel Delivery
Faxes delivered where people work: email, Slack, Teams, EHR integrations, webhooks.

### Pillar 3: Structured Data Extraction
Transform unstructured fax content into actionable data: patient info, urgency flags, document classification.

### Pillar 4: Enterprise Interoperability
Webhook APIs, EHR/EMR integrations, and enterprise SSO for large healthcare systems.
