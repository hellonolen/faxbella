## Pricing Strategy

### Value-Based Pricing

**Customer value calculation:**
- 50 faxes/day × 3 min/fax = 150 min/day manual work
- 150 min × 22 days = 55 hours/month
- 55 hours × $20/hour = $1,100/month labor cost
- FaxBella saves 90% = $990/month value
- Price at 10% of value = ~$100/month

**Price anchoring:**
- Show enterprise competitor prices ($500+/month)
- Position FaxBella as "Enterprise features at SMB prices"

### Discounting Guidelines

| Scenario | Max Discount |
|----------|-------------|
| Annual prepay | 17% (2 months free) |
| Non-profit | 20% |
| Startup (<2 years) | 30% |
| Multi-location (5+) | Custom |
| Competitive switch | 3 months free |

**Never discount:**
- Monthly plans
- Single-provider practices
- "Just because they asked"

## Objection Handling

### "We already have eFax"

> "eFax is great for receiving faxes digitally, but it doesn't route them. Your staff still sorts manually. FaxBella adds the intelligence layer on top—you can keep your eFax number and forward to us."

### "It's too expensive"

> "Let's do the math together. How many faxes do you receive daily? [50] And how long does sorting take? [2 hours total] At $20/hour, that's $880/month in labor. FaxBella is $99—that's a $780/month savings."

### "What if AI makes mistakes?"

> "Our AI routes correctly 95% of the time. For the 5% it's unsure about, it asks your office manager to decide. You're never surprised by a wrong delivery. And accuracy improves over time as it learns your patterns."

### "How hard is setup?"

> "10 minutes. Add your team members, copy one URL, paste it into your fax provider settings. You'll get your first routed fax within the hour. I can walk you through it on a call if you'd like."

### "Is it HIPAA compliant?"

> "Yes. We sign BAAs, encrypt all data, and never store PHI longer than needed. Our infrastructure (Convex, Cloudflare) is healthcare-grade. I can send you our security documentation and BAA template."

### "We need to think about it"

> "Totally understand. What specifically would you like to think through? If it's about whether it works, the trial is free—you can test it with real faxes. If it's budget approval, I can prepare an ROI document for your decision-maker."

> Subject: Quick question about fax sorting at [Practice]
> 
> [Name], I work with medical office managers who tell me fax sorting takes 1-2 hours daily. Is that something you deal with at [Practice]?
>
> We built FaxBella to automatically route faxes to the right doctor using AI. It takes 10 minutes to set up.
>
> Worth a 15-minute call to see if it's a fit?

**Day 7: Email #2**
> Subject: Re: Quick question about fax sorting
>
> Just following up. If fax sorting isn't a pain point for you, no worries at all. But if it is, I'd love 15 minutes to show you how we're saving practices 2+ hours/day.
>

**Day 14: Email #3 (Break up)**
> Subject: Should I close your file?
>

>
> But if you're curious, the offer stands: 14-day free trial, 10-minute setup.
